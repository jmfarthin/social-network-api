# social-network-api
This repo contains the backend code for a social network api.

## Description

This social network backend application allows you to perform CRUD functions for each of the main collections: User and Thought. In addition, it allows you to add/delete friends and add/delete reactions to thoughts. It's purpose is to showcase my current knowledge of javascript and highlight certain proficiencies such as:

- NODEjs
- Mongoose
- Schema/Models
- ODM
- CRUD operations

## Usage

Usage of this application assumes the following: that you have cloned the repo, have node, mongoDB installed.

Then, from the command line:

- 'npm i' to install depedencies
- 'node index.js' to run application

You will know that the application is running when you see the following message in the console: 'Now listening on port 3001!'

To test routes, use your favorite API tester, e.g., Insomnia.
